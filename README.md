creating a bar chart for the belly button sample data json
labeling variables is very important. Must be specific with variable names
trouble occurred when trying to initialize the variables for otu_id, otu_labels, and sample_values. When creating an array to hold data, variable name must be unique to the array, initially i named it sample which is also used as a data-place-holder name when creating the function itself. There was an undefined error that continued to occur.
